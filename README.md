# war_cpp

This program was just a practice/tutorial for me to delve back into C++. While not the best game, I wanted to practice a couple of concepts to familiarize myself
with learning C++. I know there are probably beginner mistakes, but that is the point of this program. It is to give me some baseline of where I am currently. I will then use
look back on this program as I progress to judge how far I have come in my learnings.
